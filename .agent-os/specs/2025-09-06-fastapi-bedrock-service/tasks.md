# Spec Tasks

These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-06-fastapi-bedrock-service/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-06
> Status: In Progress - Section 2 Complete

## Tasks

### 1. Project Setup and Configuration

- [x] 1.2 Initialize FastAPI project directory structure with main.py, models.py, bedrock_client.py, config.py
- [x] 1.3 Use UV for all necessary dependencies (fastapi, uvicorn, httpx, boto3, pydantic, python-dotenv)
- [x] 1.4 Set up .env.example file with required environment variables (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_REGION, BEDROCK_MODEL_ID)
- [x] 1.5 Implement config.py with environment variable loading and validation using python-dotenv
- [x] 1.6 Create basic FastAPI application structure in main.py with CORS middleware configuration
- [x] 1.7 Set up logging configuration with structured output

### 2. Core API Development

- [x] 2.1 Write tests for health endpoint functionality and response format
- [x] 2.2 Implement health check endpoint (`GET /health`) with JSON status response
- [x] 2.3 Write tests for Pydantic request/response models with validation scenarios
- [x] 2.4 Create Pydantic models in models.py for process endpoint (request model with task and content fields)
- [x] 2.5 Write tests for process endpoint structure and basic validation
- [x] 2.6 Implement basic process endpoint (`POST /process`) structure with async handling
- [x] 2.7 Add comprehensive error handling middleware with proper HTTP status codes
- [x] 2.8 Verify all tests pass

### 3. AWS Bedrock Integration

- [x] 3.2 Implement bedrock_client.py with boto3 Bedrock Runtime client setup
- [x] 3.4 Add AWS credentials validation and region configuration in bedrock client
- [x] 3.5 Write tests for Bedrock API communication with mock responses - **COMPLETED**: Comprehensive test suite with mocked boto3 responses for all error scenarios
- [x] 3.6 Implement async Bedrock model invocation using httpx for HTTP requests - **NOTE**: Implemented with boto3 instead of httpx
- [x] 3.7 Add comprehensive AWS service error handling (authentication, rate limits, service errors)
- [x] 3.8 Integrate Bedrock client with process endpoint to handle actual AI requests - **COMPLETED**: Replaced mock responses with real Bedrock calls
- [x] 3.9 Verify all tests pass - **COMPLETED**: All 50 tests pass, ruff linter clean

### 4. Testing, Validation, and Deployment Readiness

- [x] 4.1 Write comprehensive integration tests for end-to-end API workflows
- [x] 4.2 Set up pytest and pytest-asyncio testing framework with proper async test configuration
- [ ] 4.3 Write tests for CORS configuration and cross-origin request handling
- [ ] 4.4 Implement comprehensive input validation tests with edge cases and error scenarios
- [ ] 4.5 Create manual testing script or documentation for local development server startup - **PARTIAL**: README.md exists but not checked
- [ ] 4.6 Test service startup with uvicorn and verify localhost accessibility
- [ ] 4.7 Validate all environment variables are properly loaded and validated on startup
- [ ] 4.8 Verify all tests pass and service runs successfully on localhost
