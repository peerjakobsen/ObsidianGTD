## Tasks

### 1. Project Setup and Configuration

- [x] 1.2 Initialize FastAPI project directory structure with main.py, models.py, bedrock_client.py, config.py
- [x] 1.3 Use UV for all necessary dependencies (fastapi, uvicorn, httpx, boto3, pydantic, python-dotenv)
- [x] 1.4 Set up .env.example file with required environment variables (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_REGION, BEDROCK_MODEL_ID)
- [x] 1.5 Implement config.py with environment variable loading and validation using python-dotenv
