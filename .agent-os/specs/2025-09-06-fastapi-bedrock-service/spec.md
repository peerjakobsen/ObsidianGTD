> Spec: FastAPI Bedrock Service
> Created: 2025-09-06
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Create a lightweight FastAPI backend service that provides AI-powered task processing capabilities for the Obsidian GTD plugin via AWS Bedrock. The service will run locally and handle simple prompt-to-Bedrock processing with a health check endpoint for monitoring.

## User Stories

**As an Obsidian GTD plugin user**, I want the plugin to communicate with a local AI service so that I can process GTD-related tasks with AI assistance without sending data to external services.

**As a developer**, I want a health check endpoint so that I can verify the service is running and ready to accept requests before the plugin attempts to use it.

**As a system administrator**, I want the service to run locally so that I can maintain data privacy and have control over the AI processing environment.

## Spec Scope

1. FastAPI web service with basic routing and middleware setup
2. Health check endpoint (`/health`) that returns service status
3. AI processing endpoint that accepts prompts and forwards them to AWS Bedrock
4. AWS Bedrock integration for AI model communication
5. Local development server configuration for localhost deployment

## Out of Scope

- Data persistence or database models
- User authentication or authorization
- Complex prompt engineering or AI model training
- Production deployment configuration
- Frontend UI components
- Background job processing
- Caching mechanisms

## Expected Deliverable

1. A running FastAPI service accessible at localhost with documented endpoints
2. Successful health check endpoint returning appropriate status responses
3. Working AI processing endpoint that can accept prompts and return Bedrock responses
