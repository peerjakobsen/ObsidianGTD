# 2025-09-06 Recap: Obsidian Plugin Scaffold with Task Conversion

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-06-obsidian-plugin-scaffold/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully implemented the foundational Obsidian plugin structure with comprehensive settings panel, text selection command registration, and a complete development environment. The plugin now provides a solid foundation for AI-powered GTD task conversion with proper TypeScript configuration, Jest testing framework, ESBuild compilation, and hot reload development setup.

Key accomplishments include:
- Complete plugin foundation with manifest, main class, and lifecycle management
- Settings panel with backend URL configuration, timeout settings, and API key management
- Connection testing functionality to verify backend service availability
- Text selection command registration with proper editor integration
- Comprehensive test suite covering plugin initialization and manifest validation
- Development environment with hot reload, linting, and build automation
- TypeScript configuration optimized for Obsidian plugin development

## Context

Implement foundational Obsidian plugin structure with settings panel for backend configuration and text selection command that converts inbox text into properly formatted GTD tasks. The AI-powered conversion can generate multiple task types (Next Actions, Waiting For #waiting, Someday Maybe #maybe) from single selections while maintaining full Tasks plugin compatibility.
