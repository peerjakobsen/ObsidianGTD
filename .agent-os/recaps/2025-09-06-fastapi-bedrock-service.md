# FastAPI Bedrock Service - Development Recap

> Date: 2025-09-06
> Spec: FastAPI Bedrock Service
> Status: Partially Complete (32% completion)

## Project Summary

A FastAPI service designed to provide AI processing capabilities via AWS Bedrock for the Obsidian GTD plugin. The service runs on localhost to ensure complete privacy and data security while offering health check endpoints and secure prompt processing.

## Completed Features

### Project Setup and Configuration (Complete - 6/6 tasks)

**Infrastructure Foundation**
- Initialized FastAPI project directory structure with organized module separation
- Configured UV dependency management with all required packages (fastapi, uvicorn, httpx, boto3, pydantic, python-dotenv)
- Created environment configuration system with .env.example template
- Implemented config.py with proper environment variable loading and validation
- Established basic FastAPI application structure with CORS middleware
- Set up structured logging configuration for development monitoring

**Key Files Created:**
- `main.py` - FastAPI application entry point with CORS configuration
- `config.py` - Environment variable management and validation
- `bedrock_client.py` - AWS Bedrock integration client
- `models.py` - Pydantic model definitions (structure created)
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template
- `pyproject.toml` - UV dependency configuration

### AWS Bedrock Integration (Partial - 4/9 tasks)

**Bedrock Client Implementation**
- Implemented boto3 Bedrock Runtime client setup with proper configuration
- Added AWS credentials validation and region configuration
- Implemented comprehensive AWS service error handling for authentication, rate limits, and service errors
- Created async Bedrock model invocation using boto3 (opted for boto3 over httpx for better AWS integration)

**Technical Implementation Details:**
- Proper AWS credential management through environment variables
- Regional configuration support for Bedrock service endpoints
- Error handling for common AWS service issues
- Async/await pattern implementation for non-blocking operations

## Remaining Work

### Critical Missing Components

**Core API Endpoints (0/8 complete)**
- Health check endpoint (`GET /health`) - only root endpoint currently exists
- Process endpoint (`POST /process`) for AI prompt processing
- Complete Pydantic request/response models in models.py
- Error handling middleware implementation

**Testing Framework (0/8 complete)**
- No test framework setup (pytest missing from dependencies)
- No unit tests for existing components
- No integration tests for API workflows
- No validation tests for CORS and input handling

**Integration Gaps**
- Bedrock client not connected to API endpoints
- No end-to-end workflow from HTTP request to Bedrock response
- Missing input validation and error response formatting

## Technical Architecture

**Current Structure:**
```
fastapi-bedrock-service/
├── main.py              # FastAPI app with CORS (basic structure)
├── config.py            # Environment configuration ✅
├── bedrock_client.py    # AWS integration ✅
├── models.py            # Pydantic models (stub)
├── .env.example         # Config template ✅
└── pyproject.toml       # Dependencies ✅
```

**Technology Stack:**
- FastAPI with async/await support
- AWS Bedrock Runtime via boto3
- UV for dependency management
- Pydantic for data validation
- Python-dotenv for configuration

## Next Steps Priority

1. **Complete Core API Development**
   - Implement missing `/health` and `/process` endpoints
   - Finish Pydantic models for request/response handling
   - Add comprehensive error handling middleware

2. **Establish Testing Framework**
   - Add pytest and pytest-asyncio to dependencies
   - Create unit tests for all components
   - Implement integration tests for API workflows

3. **Connect Integration Layer**
   - Wire Bedrock client to process endpoint
   - Implement end-to-end request processing
   - Add proper error response formatting

## Key Technical Decisions

- **boto3 over httpx**: Chose boto3 for Bedrock integration for better AWS service support and built-in error handling
- **UV dependency management**: Selected for modern Python dependency management and faster resolution
- **Localhost-only deployment**: Maintains privacy requirements while supporting local development
- **Structured logging**: Implemented for better debugging and monitoring capabilities

## Blockers and Considerations

- **No test framework**: Critical for ensuring reliability and preventing regressions
- **Missing API endpoints**: Core functionality not yet accessible via HTTP
- **No integration layer**: Bedrock client exists but not connected to web interface
- **Error handling gaps**: Need comprehensive middleware for production-ready error responses

*This recap documents the foundational work completed for the FastAPI Bedrock service. The project has solid infrastructure but requires completion of core API functionality and comprehensive testing before deployment.*
