# [2025-09-07] Recap: Conversational Assistant Chat Sidebar (Task 1)

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-07-conversational-assistant-chat-sidebar/spec.md.

## Recap

Implemented the new BedrockClient.converse API with a TDD workflow. The API maps high‑level params (system, messages, inferenceConfig) to AWS Bedrock ConverseCommandInput, integrates with existing retry/fallback logic and response parsing, and exports types for public use. Added unit tests covering input mapping, retriable errors, and HTTP/SDK fallback.

- Added BedrockClient.converse({ system, messages, inferenceConfig })
- Mapped to ConverseCommandInput including system blocks
- Integrated with makeRequestWithRetry and parseBedrockResponse
- Added sensible defaults (temperature, maxTokens, topP) and exported types
- Implemented HTTP bearer fallback path to include system in body
- Wrote tests for mapping, retry behavior, and fallback paths

## Context

Spec intent (from spec-lite.md):
Implement a conversational GTD Assistant sidebar that uses a new `BedrockClient.converse({ system, messages, inferenceConfig })` API to support multi‑turn refinement of tasks and an “Insert Tasks” action to commit results into the current note. Strict JSON mode remains the default to keep outputs parseable and consistent with the existing one‑shot flow.
