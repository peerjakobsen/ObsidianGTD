# 2025-09-06 Recap: Context Tag Detection and Time Estimation

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-06-context-time-metadata/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully implemented Task 2: Response Parsing for Context Tags and Time Estimates. This involved creating comprehensive parsing logic to extract and validate context tags (@computer, @phone, @errands, etc.) and time estimates (#5m to #4h) from AI responses. The implementation includes robust fallback handling for missing or invalid metadata, enhanced error handling for partial service failures, and comprehensive test coverage for all metadata extraction scenarios.

Key accomplishments:
- Enhanced context tag validation and normalization with support for predefined GTD contexts
- Comprehensive time estimate parsing with strict format validation
- Intelligent fallback mechanisms when metadata is missing or invalid
- Fixed plugin error handling to properly display fallback tasks during service failures
- Added extensive test coverage including 539 new lines of metadata extraction tests
- All existing tests continue to pass, ensuring backward compatibility

## Context

Enhance AI-powered inbox clarification with automatic context tag detection (computer, phone, errands, etc.) and time estimation generation (#5m to #4h format) to provide richer metadata for GTD next actions. This feature improves task organization and planning by automatically categorizing actions by context and estimated effort.
