# Product Mission (Lite)

GTD Assistant is an Obsidian plugin that streamlines GTD workflows by turning raw notes into well-formed Tasks entries using AWS Bedrock â€” directly from a TypeScript client in the plugin.

It serves GTD practitioners who want consistent, metadata-rich tasks without switching tools.
