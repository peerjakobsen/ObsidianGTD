# Product Mission (Lite)

GTD Assistant is an Obsidian plugin that helps GTD practitioners streamline their workflow by providing AI-powered inbox processing and weekly review assistance with full Tasks plugin compatibility.

GTD Assistant serves GTD practitioners using Obsidian who need to efficiently convert raw inbox items into properly formatted next actions. Unlike manual text processing or external GTD tools, GTD Assistant uses AI to automatically generate metadata-rich tasks with context tags, time estimates, and project associations while maintaining full compatibility with the existing Obsidian Tasks plugin ecosystem.
