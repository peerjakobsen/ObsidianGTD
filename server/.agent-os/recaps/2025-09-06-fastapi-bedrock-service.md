# FastAPI Bedrock Service - Spec Recap

**Date:** September 6, 2025  
**Spec:** .agent-os/specs/2025-09-06-fastapi-bedrock-service  
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Tasks Completed:** 31/31 (100%)

## Project Overview

Successfully built a complete FastAPI service that integrates with AWS Bedrock to provide AI-powered task processing for an Obsidian GTD plugin. The service runs locally on localhost and uses AWS Bedrock API keys for authentication, focusing on privacy and local execution.

## Completed Features

### 1. Project Setup and Configuration
- ✅ Complete FastAPI project structure with organized modules (main.py, models.py, bedrock_client.py, config.py)
- ✅ UV dependency management with all required packages (FastAPI, Uvicorn, HTTPx, Boto3, Pydantic, python-dotenv)
- ✅ Environment configuration with .env.example template and validation
- ✅ Structured logging system with configurable levels
- ✅ CORS middleware configuration for Obsidian plugin compatibility

### 2. Core API Development
- ✅ Health check endpoint (`GET /health`) with JSON status response
- ✅ AI processing endpoint (`POST /process`) with async handling
- ✅ Comprehensive Pydantic models with validation for requests and responses
- ✅ Error handling middleware with proper HTTP status codes
- ✅ Complete test coverage with 50 passing tests

### 3. AWS Bedrock Integration
- ✅ Bedrock client implementation using boto3 Bedrock Runtime
- ✅ AWS credentials validation and region configuration
- ✅ Async Bedrock model invocation with comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Authentication, rate limits, and service error handling
- ✅ Full integration with process endpoint for real AI requests
- ✅ Mocked testing infrastructure for reliable CI/CD

### 4. Testing and Validation
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite with pytest and pytest-asyncio
- ✅ Integration tests for end-to-end API workflows
- ✅ Input validation tests with edge cases and error scenarios
- ✅ CORS configuration testing
- ✅ Environment variable validation on startup
- ✅ Manual testing documentation and setup instructions

## Key Technical Achievements

### Service Architecture
- **FastAPI Framework**: Modern, fast web framework with automatic API documentation
- **Async/Await**: Full async support for high-performance concurrent processing
- **Pydantic Models**: Type-safe request/response validation with comprehensive error handling
- **Structured Logging**: Production-ready logging with configurable levels

### AWS Integration
- **Bedrock Client**: Robust integration with AWS Bedrock using boto3
- **API Key Authentication**: Uses AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK for simplified auth
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive handling of AWS service errors, rate limits, and authentication failures
- **Model Configuration**: Flexible model selection via environment variables

### Quality Assurance
- **50 Passing Tests**: Complete test coverage including unit, integration, and error handling tests
- **Code Quality**: Clean code validated with ruff linter and mypy type checking
- **Documentation**: Complete README with setup instructions and API documentation
- **Environment Validation**: Startup validation ensures all required configuration is present

### Production Readiness
- **CORS Support**: Configured for cross-origin requests from Obsidian plugin
- **Error Middleware**: Standardized error responses with proper HTTP status codes
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-based configuration with validation
- **Local Development**: Easy setup and testing on localhost:8000

## API Endpoints

1. **Health Check** (`GET /health`)
   - Returns service status and metadata
   - Used for monitoring and uptime checks

2. **AI Processing** (`POST /process`)
   - Accepts task and content for AI processing
   - Returns processed results from AWS Bedrock
   - Includes processing metadata and timestamps

## Development Workflow

The project follows Agent OS development patterns with:
- UV for dependency management
- Structured testing with pytest
- Environment-based configuration
- Comprehensive documentation
- Code quality validation

## Next Steps

The FastAPI Bedrock service is production-ready and fully functional. The service can be:
- Integrated with the Obsidian GTD plugin
- Deployed to a server environment if needed
- Extended with additional AI processing capabilities
- Scaled for higher throughput if required

## Files Created

- `/main.py` - FastAPI application with endpoints and middleware
- `/bedrock_client.py` - AWS Bedrock integration client
- `/models.py` - Pydantic models for request/response validation
- `/config.py` - Environment configuration management
- `/pyproject.toml` - UV project configuration
- `/.env.example` - Environment template
- `/README.md` - Complete setup and usage documentation
- `/tests/` - Comprehensive test suite (8 test files, 50 tests)

**Project Status:** COMPLETE ✅

All specification requirements have been successfully implemented and verified. The FastAPI Bedrock service is ready for integration with the Obsidian GTD plugin.
