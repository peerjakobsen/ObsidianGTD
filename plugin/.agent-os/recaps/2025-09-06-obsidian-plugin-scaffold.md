# 2025-09-06 Recap: Obsidian Plugin Scaffold with GTD Task Conversion

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-06-obsidian-plugin-scaffold/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully implemented a comprehensive Obsidian plugin scaffold for GTD task conversion with complete development infrastructure, settings management, and AI-powered clarification workflow. The plugin provides a solid foundation for converting inbox text into properly formatted GTD tasks using AWS Bedrock integration through a local FastAPI backend.

Key accomplishments include:
- **Plugin Foundation**: Complete TypeScript-based plugin structure with proper Obsidian API integration, lifecycle management, and hot reload development environment
- **Settings Panel**: Comprehensive configuration interface with backend URL settings, timeout controls, API key management, and connection testing functionality
- **Command Integration**: Text selection-based command registration with keyboard shortcuts and proper editor integration
- **GTD Clarification Workflow**: Full API client implementation for communicating with backend service, supporting multiple task types (Next Actions, Waiting For, Someday Maybe)
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Extensive Jest test suite covering plugin initialization, settings validation, command registration, and API integration
- **Development Environment**: Complete build system with ESBuild, hot reload, linting, automated deployment to Obsidian vault
- **Tasks Plugin Compatibility**: Full integration with Obsidian Tasks plugin format including checkbox syntax, dates, and priorities

## Context

Implement foundational Obsidian plugin structure with settings panel for backend configuration and text selection command that converts inbox text into properly formatted GTD tasks. The AI-powered conversion can generate multiple task types (Next Actions, Waiting For #waiting, Someday Maybe #maybe) from single selections while maintaining full Tasks plugin compatibility.
